A nice and simple question!

To reverse the order of lines in a file (or output) in Linux, you can use the `tac` command. It's similar to the `cat` command, but it prints the lines in reverse order.

Here are a few examples:

```
* `tac file.txt`: Reverses the order of the lines in the file `file.txt`.
* `tac - | less`: Pipes the output of `tac` (reversed lines) to `less`, allowing you to page through the output.
* `tac file.txt | grep pattern`: Searches for a specific pattern in the reversed lines.
```

So, if you want to revert the order of lines in one command, just use:
```bash
tac your_file.txt
```
Replace `your_file.txt` with the name of your file.
