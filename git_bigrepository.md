our team's repository is too big, for too long history and many binary files, .git folder size is 30GB, how to optimize that?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can optimize your repository by reducing its size. Here's a step-by-step plan:

- Backup your repository: Before making any changes, it's a good idea to create a backup of your repository.
- Remove unnecessary files: Use the git rm command to remove unnecessary files from your repository.
- Remove large files: Use the git filter-branch command or a tool like BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove large files from your repository's history.
- Remove old commits: If your repository has a long history, you can use the git rebase command to squash old commits together.
- Run garbage collection: Use the git gc command to clean up unnecessary files and optimize your repository.
- Push changes: Finally, push your changes to the remote repository.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
# Backup your repository
cp -R your-repo your-repo-backup

# Navigate to your repository
cd your-repo

# Remove unnecessary files
git rm unnecessary-file

# Remove large files
# Use BFG Repo-Cleaner (https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)
bfg --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M

# Remove old commits
# This command squashes all commits older than 1 month into one
git rebase --root --preserve-merges --strategy-option=theirs --exec "if [ $(git rev-list --count HEAD^..HEAD) -eq 1 ] && [ $(git show --pretty=%ad --date=short -s HEAD) \< $(date -d '1 month ago' +%Y-%m-%d) ]; then git reset --soft HEAD^ && git commit -C HEAD@{1}; fi"

# Run garbage collection
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Push changes
git push origin --force
```

Please note that these operations can drastically alter your repository and its history. Make sure you understand what each command does before running it. Always keep a backup of your repository.

After that your team should clone the repository again or `git pull --allow-unrelated-histories` to overwritten local history.
