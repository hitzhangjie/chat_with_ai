The command `git config --global rerere.enabled = true` enables the **Reuse Recorded Resolution (rerere)** feature in Git.

**What is rerere?**

- rerere stands for **Reuse Recorded Resolution**.
- It allows Git to remember how you have resolved conflicts in the past for specific hunks in tracked files.
- If the same conflict arises again for the same hunk in a future commit, Git can automatically reuse your previous resolution.

**Purpose of enabling rerere:**

- Helps escape recurring conflict hell by automating conflict resolution.
- Saves time and reduces the risk of inconsistencies in resolved conflicts.

**How it works:**

- When you resolve a conflict using `git add` or `git commit`, Git tracks your resolution for the affected hunk.
- If the same hunk appears in a future conflict, Git checks its record and suggests the previously resolved version.

**Command explanation:**

- `git config --global`: Sets the configuration globally, affecting all repositories.
- `rerere.enabled = true`: Enables the rerere feature for conflict resolution.

**In summary, the command `git config --global rerere.enabled = true` allows Git to remember and reuse previous conflict resolutions, thereby simplifying conflict resolution and reducing the burden of recurring conflicts.**
