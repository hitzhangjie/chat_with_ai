how to work around the systemd-coredump.service problem in WSL2?

see: https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/11997#issuecomment-2973395693

---

```
$ sysctl kernel.core_pattern
kernel.core_pattern = |/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-coredump %P %u %g %s %t %c %h %e
```

this pattern is a new method to process coredump generation.

on my WSL2+rhel8.5, it not working, when I send SIGBUS to target process, kernel try to generate core, and dmesg reports connect to systemd coredump service failed.

```

Then I checked the running status:

```
$ sudo systemctl status systemd-coredump.socket
‚óè systemd-coredump.socket - Process Core Dump Socket

```

and

```
$ sudo systemctl status systemd-coredump.service
Unit systemd-coredump.service could not be found.
```

I searched and it said systemd-coredump should be part of systemd. Then how to work around this?

1. change the core.pattern to old core.xxxxx, it works.
2. if you change pattern to /var/cores/... then make sure /var/cores/... can be written by EUID/EGID of your running process.

The coredump is created and written to by the kernel with the EUID/EGID of your running process.
