Let me explain how tinydbg and starlark work together based on the codebase:

1. **Integration Overview**:
- tinydbg integrates Starlark (a Python-like scripting language) as a way to extend and automate debugging functionality
- The integration is primarily handled through the `pkg/terminal/starbind` package which provides bindings between tinydbg's debugger API and Starlark

2. **Key Components**:

a) **Starlark Environment**:
- Defined in `pkg/terminal/starbind/starlark.go`
- Provides a context for executing Starlark scripts with access to debugger functionality
- Includes built-in functions that map to debugger operations

b) **Built-in Functions**:
The debugger exposes several built-in functions to Starlark scripts:
- `dlv_command`: Execute debugger commands
- `eval`: Evaluate expressions in the current context
- `breakpoints`: Manage breakpoints
- `stacktrace`: Get stack trace information
- `state`: Get current debugger state
- And many more debugging operations

3. **Usage Example**:
From `examples/starlark_demo/README.md`, here's how it works:

```bash
# 1. Compile the target program
go build main.go

# 2. Start the debugger
tinydbg ./main

# 3. Use Starlark scripts
(tinydbg) source debug.star
```

4. **Script Capabilities**:
Starlark scripts can:
- Set and manage breakpoints
- Execute debugger commands
- Access current scope information
- Save debugging information to files
- Define and call custom functions
- Automate debugging workflows

5. **Implementation Details**:
- The `starlarkContext` struct in `pkg/terminal/starlark.go` provides the interface between tinydbg and Starlark
- It implements methods for:
  - Client access
  - Command registration
  - Command execution
  - Scope management
  - Configuration loading

6. **Value Conversion**:
- The `pkg/terminal/starbind/conv.go` file handles conversion between Go types and Starlark values
- Supports various data types including:
  - Basic types (bool, int, string)
  - Complex types (maps, structs)
  - Error handling

7. **Safety Features**:
- Script execution is sandboxed
- Includes step limiting to prevent infinite loops
- Error handling and cancellation support
- Type checking and conversion safety

This integration allows users to write powerful debugging scripts that can automate complex debugging tasks, while maintaining safety and control over the debugging process. The Starlark scripting capability makes tinydbg more flexible and programmable compared to traditional debuggers that only support interactive commands.
